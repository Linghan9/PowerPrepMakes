<h1>II. App Branding</h1>
<ul><li>
  Make sure VDOT color. Also if we were to do the branding/logo, just need photo shop download and I used photo shop before. </li>
<li>Make sure customized resources are linked to correct place. </li>
<li>Restaurant to add GPS maps. </li>
<li>Load sponsor guide into the resources for everyyear to show loading deck/ move in- move out info. </li>
<li>Enable Web App Spearker Page (make speaker stand out more) need to pre-approve color and pattern. </li>
<li>Branded Event URL (add on 800 not necessary)</li>
<li>Features we don’t use: Moderators bios. If we were to include that we need to collect those early or send out speaker emails early to allow them to edit. Speaker Bios <> introduction bio </li>

<li>Floormap -> Make it flexible to update.  (need to show where it should be improved by providing an example)
</li></ul>

<h1>Follow up with Vance after workshop </h1>
1.	Attendee analytic seems off.  (fixed that In power BI) 
2.	Emails glitch prior to workshop. Allow update within 4 hrs. 
3.	Attendee login, login code, some received some don’t. 
4.	Photo access/ personal note access (how long) specific date (December 18th? So I communicate with Elizabeth) 
5.	Floor map update can be painful if one mistake was made. (go back and figure out what exactly is the problem). 

6.	Trivia game is nice but we’d like to see it build into the session. 


7.	How long we can access to the post event survey. (3 months till Dec 18th)
