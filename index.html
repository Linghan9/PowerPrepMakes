II. App Branding
Make sure VDOT color. Also if we were to do the branding/logo, just need photo shop download and I used photo shop before. 
Make sure customized resources are linked to correct place. 
Restaurant to add GPS maps. 
Load sponsor guide into the resources for everyyear to show loading deck/ move in- move out info. 
Enable Web App Spearker Page (make speaker stand out more) need to pre-approve color and pattern. 
Branded Event URL (add on 800 not necessary)
Features we don’t use: Moderators bios. If we were to include that we need to collect those early or send out speaker emails early to allow them to edit. Speaker Bios <> introduction bio 


Floormap -> Make it flexible to update.  (need to show where it should be improved by providing an example)



 


 

III. Agenda Center 
Speaker conflict check- check for speaker and room availability to make sure room is not double booked (seems not necessary) 
Session QA Need have ability to modify session moderator email before automatic send off.
